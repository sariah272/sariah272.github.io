		<p>The price of success is hard work, dedication to the work, and determining whether we win or lose, we have exerted our best abilities for the work.</p>
		<p>No success is gained instantly. There is no one who sells success. The only person who can give you success is yourself. Not with the money and treasures you have, you can only get it when you really work hard and dedicate yourself and even live for the goal you want to achieve.</p>
		<p>Be yourself, express yourself, rest assured of yourself, do not go and look for a successful personality and duplicate it.</p>
		<p>There has never been a story of a successful person without a struggle. Behind people's success, there are their stories when trying to make their lives better every day. Not infrequently we encounter the stories of those who always try with all their might, dedicating their lives to work as hard and smart as possible so that their dreams are realized. Not infrequently they also experience failures in their lives. But they never gave up and even continued to do the same struggle</p>
		<p>Achieving success does not require convoluted conditions. It is enough to get used to living in a disciplined manner in carrying out good habits and obeying the schedule that has been made to complete their work.</p>	
		<p>There is no equal success between one person and another. Behind each person's success lies their own story of struggle, joy, and sorrow. You can be inspired to achieve success like a certain person, but you can't duplicate his success. He lived different things with you and vice versa. Imitate the spirit but fight alone to achieve what you want.</p>

		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>Success is everyone's right. The thing is how people strive for themselves to be able to achieve success. There are people who are very persistent to achieve success, some are mediocre. Some seem ordinary but actually strive for success for their own lives.</p>
		<p>Presumably this matter should be pondered by everyone including you. How you will live life in the future, how you see yourself in the next 10 years, how can you manage yourself and your family, are all personal decisions.</p>
		<p>Take the positive side of this spirit of sustainability and achieve success according to your version. You may fail many times but at least it makes you realize that you have tried continuously.</p>
		<p>Without a preparation, you can't finish the job with a good and satisfactory finish. You need to be able to make a good preparation for a job. Perhaps the work is preparation for the next job. If you don't start well, you can never get off work.</p>
		<p>Achieving success does not require convoluted conditions. It is enough to get used to living in a disciplined manner in carrying out good habits and obeying the schedule that has been made to complete their work.</p>	
		<p>Success is not the ultimate goal. You will never feel successful when you don't love and trust the work you do, so you feel that the journey to success is too long and makes you tired of fighting. This is your teaser. The thing that can get rid of this kind of situation is that you have to love your job and believe that you can solve it.</p>

		<p>There is no equal success between one person and another. Behind each person's success lies their own story of struggle, joy, and sorrow. You can be inspired to achieve success like a certain person, but you can't duplicate his success. He lived different things with you and vice versa. Imitate the spirit but fight alone to achieve what you want.</p>
		<p>Success does not come by itself. He is not a living thing, let alone a social being who understands the nature of money. You can't exchange treasures for success. When you want yourself to be in a position of success, then you have to show that action and really work to make what you call a success. It would be useless for you to have a myriad of dreams but never work for them.</p>
		<p>If you think that being a successful person can make you the happiest person, then you are very wrong. In fact, it is not success that makes you happy, but it is happiness that leads you to success. You may have a big company, be a leader, a bountiful treasure, and everything that smells material is almost all you have,
		But when you don't feel happy with all your accomplishments, what do all these treasures mean? Outsiders consider you to be a successful person but yourself never enjoy the fruits of your hard work. Which is called success?.</p>
